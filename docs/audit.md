## 1. Purpose
This audit ensures **ProxyPulse** meets all specified requirements, quality standards, and best practices across code, CI/CD, packaging, testing, documentation, and support mechanisms before v1.0 release.

## 2. Scope
- Repository structure & coding conventions  
- Dependency management & SDK pinning  
- Core interfaces & module implementations  
- Logging, telemetry & support features  
- Automated tests (unit, integration, UI)  
- CI/CD workflows (build, test, security scan, release)  
- Packaging & installer (Inno Setup, MSIX, auto-update)  
- Documentation & runbooks  
- Security, performance & usability criteria  

## 3. Audit Standards & References
- **.NET Best Practices**: Microsoft .NET guidelines, StyleCop rules  
- **Security**: OWASP top 10, GitHub CodeQL policies  
- **Packaging**: Inno Setup reference, MSIX packaging docs  
- **Testing**: xUnit conventions, Coverlet coverage ≥ 80%, FlaUI UI automation guidelines  
- **Documentation**: Docs as Code principles, Markdown linting  

## 4. Audit Methodology
1. **Static Review**  
   - Inspect files/directories against spec  
   - Validate `.editorconfig`, `stylecop.json`, `global.json`, `Directory.Build.props`  
2. **Build & CI Verification**  
   - Execute local `dotnet build`, `dotnet test`  
   - Trigger PR to confirm GitHub Actions steps (restore, build, test, CodeQL)  
3. **Runtime Smoke Tests**  
   - Launch `ProxyPulse.exe` on clean Windows VM  
   - Verify wizard flows, fetcher errors, routing enable/disable  
4. **Automated Test Execution**  
   - Run unit, integration, and UI test suites; confirm pass rates  
   - Generate and analyze coverage reports  
5. **Packaging Validation**  
   - Build Inno Setup and MSIX packages  
   - Install/uninstall on VMs, verify driver registration, config cleanup  
6. **Operational Scenarios**  
   - Simulate network/API failures, check health-check behavior  
   - Test auto-update with version bump, checksum validation  
7. **Documentation & Runbook Accuracy**  
   - Read `/docs` files, compare against implementations  
   - Execute runbook steps to resolve common issues  
8. **Security & Performance Checks**  
   - Run CodeQL scans, dependency-vulnerability tools  
   - Perform 1,000-connection benchmark, measure latency/memory  

At each step, record **evidence** (logs, screenshots, test reports) and raise **discrepancies** as GitHub issues.

*Chain of Thought & Quality Assurance:*  
At each audit step, articulate observations, rationale for pass/fail decisions, and reference the exact spec clause (e.g., "Section 3.2: .csproj PackageReferences"). This traceability ensures full accountability and high confidence in ProxyPulse's readiness for production.
