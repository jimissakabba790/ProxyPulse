# Security Audit Guide

## Overview
This document outlines security checks and best practices for ProxyPulse, focusing on critical security aspects such as driver installation, IPC mechanisms, HTTP authentication, and configuration secrets.

## Quick Penetration Test

### Prerequisites
- Clean Windows VM
- Wireshark or similar network analyzer
- Basic pen testing tools (e.g., Burp Suite)

### Test Procedure

1. **Installation Security**
   - Install with non-admin user, verify appropriate privilege escalation
   - Check file/folder permissions after install
   - Verify driver signature and integrity

2. **Network Security**
   - Monitor all network traffic during startup
   - Verify no unencrypted credentials in transit
   - Test proxy authentication mechanisms
   - Verify SOCKS5 handshake security

3. **Local Security**
   - Check for sensitive data in logs
   - Verify secure storage of proxy credentials
   - Test IPC channel security
   - Check for leftover files after uninstall

## OWASP-Style Checklist

### Driver Installation
- [ ] Driver signed with valid certificate
- [ ] Installation requires proper elevation
- [ ] Minimal required permissions set
- [ ] Clean uninstallation possible

### IPC Security
- [ ] Named pipes use proper ACLs
- [ ] Messages properly authenticated
- [ ] No sensitive data in IPC
- [ ] Proper error handling

### HTTP Authentication
- [ ] TLS validation enabled
- [ ] Credentials never logged
- [ ] Failed auth properly handled
- [ ] Session timeout implemented

### Configuration Security
- [ ] Secrets properly encrypted
- [ ] Secure credential storage
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Secure config updates

## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate fix required
- **High**: Fix in next release
- **Medium**: Schedule for future release
- **Low**: Document and track

### Reporting Process
1. Document the finding
2. Assess impact and severity
3. Create GitHub security advisory
4. Implement and validate fix
5. Update security documentation

## Regular Security Tasks

### Daily
- Review CodeQL scan results
- Check dependency vulnerabilities

### Weekly
- Review access logs
- Check for new CVEs in dependencies

### Monthly
- Full penetration test
- Review and update security docs
